    <p>
      This is Dado 3, his name is <em>Ahnaf Tahmid Fahid</em>. This is the big
      dado. All he likes is to torture us mini-dados, but he is a pure-hearted
      man. This dado is multitalented he teaches dumb teens and does complex
      coding. That isn't all that this Dado can do he can also write well, give
      him a topic and he will stir up an article within minutes
